* Put your credentials into a format that Factory understands

Run:

$ /usr/bin/create-ec2-factory-credentials

This is an interactive script that accepts your EC2 account ID, access key and secret key and (optionally) x509 certs.

It will save a file called "ec2_credentials.xml"


* Single Command:

(must be run as root)

# imagefactory --debug provider_image --file-parameter install_script f20-official-cloud.ks --template f20-jeos.tdl ec2 @ec2-us-west-2 ec2_credentials.xml

This will actually go through three distinct steps.

1) It will build a "base_image" using the kickstart file and tdl file provided

2) It will create a "target_image" for EC2 based on this base_image

3) It will push/upload the target_image to ec2-us-west-2
