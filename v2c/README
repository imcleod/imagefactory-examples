Image Factory can convert VM images to Docker containers.

We do this by first importing the VM image as a new base_image and
then running the existing Docker target plugin against the imported
image.

You will need a recent upstream version, ideally, the RPMs here:

https://copr.fedoraproject.org/coprs/imcleod/imagefactory-docker-devel/


Here is a simple example, using the Fedora 22 cloud image as an input

NOTE: The intput image can be in any format that qemu-img understands
and that contains an OS that libguestfs can successfully inspect.

# Get the image

$ wget https://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/releases/22/Cloud/x86_64/Images/Fedora-Cloud-Base-22-20150521.x86_64.qcow2

# Import it as a base image
# Remember that we must run the Factory CLI as root and the input image must be
# in a location that libvirtd can read

$ sudo imagefactory --debug import_base_image /tmp/Fedora-Cloud-Base-22-20150521.x86_64.qcow2

# The resulting image file can now be used as the input to a "docker load" command
# Simple things like launching /bin/bash in this container should now work
# More complicated tasks, like launching services, may require additional changes
# accomplished by building Docker layered images using this import as a base
